# SureCloud

## UI Developer Coding Challenge

### Overview

The following ticket is a good example of how work is defined at SureCloud, albeit with arbitary subject matter.
Please follow the instructions below to complete the task. You can spend as long as you need on the challenge with a guideline of around 2-4hours.

When complete, please delete `node_modules` & zip the folder up and return to SureCloud prior to the next interview stage.

### Challenge Rules

- run `npm install` to add local dependencies.
- Use only the default libraries provided in `package.json`, (Angular, TypeScript, RxJS).
- No other libraries should be used/installed.
- If you prefer to use `scss`, please amend the project configuration to do so.
- Try to structure code as if was part of a normal large-scale production project.
- Bonus Points for Unit/Component tests.
- No server-side code is neccessary. Use browser capabilities to persist relevent data.

Please complete the following user story:
